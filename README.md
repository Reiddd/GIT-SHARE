# GIT-SHARE

this is the place I keep all my codes I wrote during my study.

this repository contains many different parts.

it include c++ code examples I wrote when I was learning Qt, boost, and python code examples I wrote when I was learning django. also bash scripts I wrote when I was learing linux comand line.

it's really a mess, sorry if it bothers you.
